We solved the common issue with stripped gears (motor runs but drive shaft does not turn) with our larger gear box design.
In 2005, MIDDLEBY changed to this style motor which is more efficient, has a larger gear box, and has the speed sensor included in the silver cap. This motor runs cooler and last longer compared to the SCR rated motor being sold elsewhere. If you are replacing this motor, you will need to purchase the conveyor control pick-up speed sensor kit (sold separately) as it is used in conjunction with this motor.

This gear drive motor replaces the BALDOR brand and can be used on most MIDDLEBY MARSHALL conveyor ovens and replaces gear motors with a ratio of 1400:1. In 2005, MIDDLEBY changed to this more efficient, larger gear box motor which has the speed sensor included in the silver cap. This motor runs cooler and last longer compared to the SCR rated motor being sold elsewhere. If you are replacing this motor, you will need to purchase the conveyor control pick-up speed sensor kit (sold separately) as it is used in conjunction with this motor. OEM part numbers are used for reference only, see our conditions of use page for more details. Replaces MIDDLEBY 46444.


Replaces Model Numbers:
MIDDLEBY 46444

Specifications:
Volts: 90DC
Gear Ratio: 1400:1

Includes:
1 New gear drive motor 
&nbsp;


Gear drive motor replacement works on the following pizza ovens:
MIDDLEBY JS300/PS300
MIDDLEBY JS350/PS350
MIDDLEBY JS360/PS360
Most MIDDLEBY PS570 ovens

Replaces MIDDLEBY part numbers 46603, 27384-0008 as is.
Replaces MIDDLEBY 47796 and 50265 with the addition of the conveyor control pick-up speed sensor kit (sold separately).

Our motor requires the speed sensor to be mounted externally with a hose clamp and the spinning magnet is visible. If you are replacing the lighter motor, you will need to order our conveyor control pick-up speed sensor kit (sold separately). When installing this motor, green is ground. The blue and brown wires go to the speed control.

The Hoshizaki 214243-01 Cube Guide is a replacement part for Hoshizaki ice machines. It is used to guide the ice cubes from the evaporator into the storage bin. The cube guide is made of durable plastic and is designed to fit perfectly in the ice machine. It helps to ensure that the cubes are released properly and that they are not stuck in the evaporator. The cube guide also helps to reduce noise and vibration from the machine, as well as preventing ice cubes from being crushed or broken during release. This part is essential for proper operation of your Hoshizaki ice machine and should be replaced if it becomes damaged or worn out

It is ideal for use with ice machines and ice applications, but can also be used with office water, coffee and espresso applications (if water temperature exceeds 125 F, the cartridge requires a high temperature housing).

Because the ScaleStick dispense a controlled amount of the food-grade Hydroblend compound, it is a more practical and effective scale prevention method than standard phosphate treatments.

The ScaleStick cartridge fits most standard 10&quot; housings, as well as Everpure&#39;s current SR-X housings and all existing AR-X housings (old style). The cartridge is translucent, so you can easily monitor your filter&#39;s life.&nbsp;
